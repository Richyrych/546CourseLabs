# 546CourseLabs

This repository contains several hands-on labs completed during my CS 546 course.  Each lab focuses on a new technology and/or skill, and successive labs built upon the dependencies used in former assignments. These labs ran concurrent with our final group project, a full-stack application with client-side and server-side authentication, database structure and queries, dynamic page updates and asynchronous functionality.

## Lab Structure
Each lab is contained in its own folder with independent dependencies and execution, and will have their own individual README description.
